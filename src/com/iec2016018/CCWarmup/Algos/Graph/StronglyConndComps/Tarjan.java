            A L G O

        1:  DFS search produces a DFS tree/forest
        2:  Strongle connected components form subtrees of the DFS tree
        3:  If we can find head of such subtrees, we can print/store
            all the nodes in that subtree (including head) and that will
            be one StronglyConndComps.
        4:  There is no back edge from one StronglyConndComps to another (There can
            be cross edges, but cross edges will not be used while
            processing the graph).

            NoTE:   Java code is not present on GFG
